## Question 1
You are provided with a shell script binary 1. hunt.sh.x. Only execute permissions are given to the script.
Upon running it, youâ€™ll receive a unique README file and a unique `directory tree`. Navigate into the
directory to find a README file. Follow the instructions given in your respective README file, follow the
instructions at every stage and obtain the final key. Name your answer script as `question1.sh`, and
attach the key in this shell script. Executing your script should only output the key you find. Feel free
