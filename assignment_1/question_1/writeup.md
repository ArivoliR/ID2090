# Welcome to Treasure Hunt.
## First Challenge:
## There is a Giratina inside.
### If you dont know what Giratina is, it is a Legendary Ghost Pokemon.
### Similarily, you will see a ghost file inside, which you can't see in your naked eyes.
### But if you could access it, it would serve you forever.
